Coding Assignments

The course website: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/

These are my solutions for this above course (Spring 2016-2017). I did not enroll in Stanford to take this course and am greatful to have the generous access to the course notes, lecture videos and assignment codes, which is made public for everyone. I am welcome to hear about any errors, if found in these codes.

Assignment list:

    Assignment 1:
        Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier
        Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine
        Q3: Implementing a Softmax classifier
        Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network
